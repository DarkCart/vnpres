# vnpres
General purpose program for visual novel Discord Rich Presence

### How does it work?
vnpres uses a java Discord Rich Presence wrapper to provide more details about the visual novel you're currently playing. 

The images that it uses come from a Discord Rich Presence app that's manually set up for each visual novel.

### How can I add a visual novel?
Contact `Sgt. Pepper#8014` on Discord with a title and character sprites for each route.

#### Okay, that's cool, but couldn't this be used for something more general than visual novels?
Yeah, but I'm a weeaboo
